There was once a poor shepherd boy who used to watch his flocks in the fields
next to a dark forest near the foot of a mountain. One hot afternoon, he thought
up a good plan to get some company for himself and also have a little fun. Raising
his fist in the air, he ran down to the village shouting "Wolf, Wolf." As soon as they
heard him, the villagers all rushed from their homes, full of concern for his safety,
and two of his cousins even stayed with him for a short while. This gave the boy so
much pleasure that a few days later he tried exactly the same trick again, and
once more he was successful. However, not long after, a wolf that had just
escaped from the zoo was looking for a change from its usual diet of chicken and
duck. So, overcoming its fear of being shot, it actually did come out from the
forest and began to threaten the sheep. Racing down to the village, the boy of
course cried out even louder than before. Unfortunately, as all the villagers were
convinced that he was trying to fool them a third time, they told him, "Go away
and don't bother us again." And so the wolf had a feast.
